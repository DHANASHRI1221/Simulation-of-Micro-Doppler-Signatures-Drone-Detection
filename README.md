# üõ∞Ô∏è Simulation of Micro-Doppler Signatures & Drone Detection (ML)

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Micro-Doppler signature simulation** and **drone detection using Machine Learning techniques**.
Micro-Doppler signatures arise from micro-motions (e.g., rotor blades of drones, swinging arms, etc.) in radar returns. They are powerful features for target recognition and classification.

The goal of this project is to:

* Simulate **radar micro-Doppler signatures** for different drone and non-drone targets.
* Extract time-frequency features (e.g., spectrograms, STFT, wavelets).
* Train ML models for **drone vs. non-drone detection**.
* Evaluate classification accuracy under noise and varying SNR conditions.
